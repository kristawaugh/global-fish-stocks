#Investigating the North-Atlantic Cod

## Plotting Canada's overfishing trends 

Here, we were able to recreate the above graph by plotting the total catch in Canada. To produce this graph, we used the filter() function to single out a specific country, Canada. 

```{r }
cod %>%
  filter(country == "Canada") %>%
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarise(total_catch = sum(tsvalue, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(tsyear, total_catch)) + geom_line()

```

##Analysis: Canada's overfishing trends versus worldwide 

Based on the amount of cod caught in Canada in the 19th century, Canada has a longer history of heavy fishing and it's water have been heavily fished consitently over time. Simialr to the graph of the total fish caught throughout the world, the amount of fish caught spikedto its highest amount around the 1960s. But unlike the cod catches worldwide, the amount caught in Canada dropped overall in the late 1970s, due a regulation put in place to put regulation of fishing in control of the goverment for 200 miles offshore.  This is not reflected in the worldwide graph because this regulationmonly occured in Canadian waters. 

#Examining Fishing Stock Collapses

We seek to replicate the temporal trend in stock declines shown in [Worm et al 2006](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294):

![](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/worm2006.jpg)


This graph plots data from about 1950 to 2006. This graph is plotting species richness in differnet areas. The diamond shapes are plotting by year, and the triangles are plotting cumulative losses in species richness. The marine ecosystems lacking in species richness are expressing a much faster rate of decline than the marine ecosystems with high levels of species richness. 



```{r}
# carl/andrew code, solid
fishes <-
  ram$timeseries_values_views %>%
  select(assessid, stockid, year, SSB, TC) %>%
  left_join(ram$stock) %>%
  left_join(ram$area) %>% 
  left_join(ram$timeseries_units_views %>% 
      rename(TC_units = TC, SSB_units = SSB)) %>% 
  select(commonname, areaname, country, year, SSB, TC,
         TC_units, SSB_units,
         scientificname, assessid, stockid, areaid)
fishes
```

```{r}
#The filters below were removed because they were deemed unneccesary
 #filter(tscategory == "CATCH or LANDINGS")  %>%
 #filter(tsunitsshort == "MT") %>%
first_fish <- fishes %>%   
  group_by(year, scientificname) %>%
  summarize(combine_stocks = sum(TC, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(year >= 1950, year <= 2006) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  tally() 

  
first_fish
 
```

##Plotting total taxa caught worldwide 1950-2006

To adapt the table we created in the first exercise, we selected and 
manipulated the necessary columns to plot the number of total taxa caught each year 
from 1950 til 2006 using ggplot2. 


```{r}
ggplot(first_fish, aes(x= year, n)) + geom_point()

```

##Removing incomplete datasets

Here, we manipulated the data do remove all NA values, and species fo fish that don't have data for the full 57 year range between 1950 and 2006. 


```{r}
#filtering out the tally using "57" collects the values for which there is data for all 57 years.
second_fish <- fishes %>%   
  group_by(year, scientificname) %>%
  summarize(combine_stocks = sum(TC)) %>%
  filter(year >= 1950, year <= 2006) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(scientificname) %>%
  count(by = "tsyear") %>%
  filter(n == 57)
 
  
second_fish


```

```{r}
taxa <-
ram$taxonomy %>% 
  left_join(ram$stock, by = "tsn") %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid") %>%
  left_join(ram$timeseries, by= "stockid") %>%
  left_join(ram$tsmetrics, by = c("tsid" = "tsunique")) %>%

taxa %>%

## Task 3: Which fisheries have collapsed?

A fishery may be considered *collapsed* when total catch (TC) falls
below 10% of its peak. For those stocks with complete data sets, create a new 
tidy table including columns: `stockid`, `TC`, `year`, `collapsed`, and `cumulative`, 
where `collapsed` is a logical (True or False) for whether or not that fishery could
be considered collapsed in that year, and `cumulative` is the count of total years
the fishery has been collapsed at that point in time. 

```{r}

##This chunk and the following dont want to run 
collapse <- taxa %>%
  left_join(fishes, by = c(tsyear = "year", "stockid")) %>%
  select("stockid", "TC", "tsyear") %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  unique() %>%
  
  filter(tsyear >= 1950) %>%
  filter(tsyear <= 2006)
collapse
``` 

```{r}
collapsed <- collapse %>%
  group_by(stockid) %>%
  mutate(collapsed = TC<(max(TC) * .1))
collapsed

collapsed_new <- collapsed %>%
  mutate(cumulative = cumsum(collapsed == 1L))
collapsed_new
  
```

  

## Task 4: Plotting total catch

Using `geom_area()` plot the TC per stockid acros all years. 
```{r}
ggplot(collapsed_new, aes(x= stockid, TC)) + geom_area()
```
